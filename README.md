# Overview

This is a Mental Health Assessment web application that uses machine learning to predict mental health outcomes for college students. The application provides an AI-powered psychological screening tool with a comprehensive questionnaire system, risk assessment capabilities, and visual analytics dashboard. It's designed to offer stigma-free, early detection of mental health issues through standardized psychological instruments like PHQ-9 and GAD-7.

# User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
The application uses a traditional server-rendered architecture with Flask templates and progressive enhancement through JavaScript. The frontend follows a Jupyter notebook-inspired design system with custom CSS that creates a familiar, academic interface. The questionnaire system implements a multi-step wizard with client-side state management and progress tracking.

## Backend Architecture
Built on Flask as the primary web framework, the application follows a simple MVC pattern with route handlers directly in the main app.py file. Session management handles user state across the multi-step questionnaire process, with form data temporarily stored in Flask sessions before processing.

## Machine Learning Pipeline
The core prediction system uses XGBoost as the primary algorithm, trained on synthetic mental health datasets that simulate realistic correlations between demographic, lifestyle, and psychological factors. The model training pipeline (train_model.py) generates synthetic data with proper statistical relationships, performs hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV, and exports trained models with preprocessing components for production use.

## Data Processing
Feature engineering includes StandardScaler for numerical features and LabelEncoder for categorical variables. The system processes multiple types of input data including demographics (age, gender, academic year), lifestyle factors (sleep duration, physical activity, dietary habits), and psychological indicators (academic pressure, social connectedness, family history).

## Visualization System
Uses Plotly.js for interactive data visualization, generating feature importance charts and risk factor analysis. The dashboard presents prediction results with color-coded risk levels and detailed breakdowns of contributing factors.

## Session Management
Implements Flask sessions with configurable secret keys for development and production environments. User data is temporarily stored during assessment completion and cleared after results are displayed.

# External Dependencies

## Python Libraries
- **Flask**: Web framework for routing and templating
- **XGBoost**: Primary machine learning algorithm for predictions
- **scikit-learn**: Data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation metrics
- **pandas/numpy**: Data manipulation and numerical computations
- **Plotly**: Interactive visualization library for charts and graphs

## Frontend Dependencies
- **Bootstrap 5.3.0**: CSS framework for responsive design and UI components
- **Font Awesome 6.4.0**: Icon library for user interface elements
- **Google Fonts**: Typography (Inter and Fira Code fonts)
- **Plotly.js**: Client-side visualization rendering

## Model Dependencies
The application requires pre-trained model files (XGBoost model, StandardScaler, feature importance data) stored in a models/ directory. These are generated by the training script and loaded at application startup.

## Environment Configuration
Uses environment variables for session secret management with fallback values for development. The application is configured to work with Replit's hosting environment through specific Flask configuration settings.
